# Installation of the ARM protocol (Last update: July31, 2015) 
#
#
# 1) Install Dowser, Modeller, Scrwl4, Molcas and Tinker
#
# 2) Install VMD and make sure it can be run sliently from prompt.  
#
# 3) Replace the file "atomdict.db" into the directory "~/dowser/DATA" to allow Dowser to recognize the RET chromophore
# 
# 4) Update sample-ARMconfig file (See details in that file) and then run install.sh 
#
#
#
# Running ARM protocol
#
# 1) Prepare the pdb file with the correct protonation states (Using PropKa: https://github.com/jensengroup/propka-3.1) 
#
# 2) Add counter-ions (Say CL or NA) as needed to make sure the whole protein is neutral. (The protocol would do a check as well) 
#
# 3) Copy New.sh file to the same directory with the pdb file
#
# 4) Prepare the "cavity" or "seqmut" as needed. (See below) 
#
# 5) Run New.sh
#
#
## "cavity" file (For specifying list of cavity residues)
##
## One can put a list of residue numbers in the file named "cavity" that would allow to move in the molecular dynamics. 
## This "cavity" file has to be put in the same folder as the initial PDB file and New.sh. 
##
## Or 
## 
## One can use the distance (in Angstroms) from the retinal chromophore to define the cavity automatically when running GROMACS 
#
#
#
#
## "seqmut file (For Mutation) 
##
## The mutation routine is activated ONLY if you place a file named "seqmut"
## in the same folder as the initial PDB file and New.sh. In that file mutations have 
## to be placed in one of the following standard format for replacements:
##     S83G
##     Tyr96Arg
## The script is case-insensitive, so also s83g, TYR78lys and so on would be accepted. 
##
## Mixed 1- and 3-letters codes will not be properly read. 
##
## If you want to perform more than 1 substitution, just list them on different lines in the same file.
## 
## Currently it is not possible to select the protonation state of the new residue by putting something like ser86glh in seqmut. 
##
## To neutralize it, you have to make the replacement with standard labels, ser86glu, 
## then manually change labels to GLH in the PDB before running NewStep.sh. 
##
## This is due to both Modeller and SCWRL4 which donâ€™t recognize protonated stuff...
##
