# Installation of the APEC protocol (Last update: April 2, 2019) 
#
#
# 1) Install Dowser, Modeller, Scrwl4, Molcas (7.8) and Tinker (5)
#
# 2) Install VMD and make sure it can be run sliently from prompt.  
#
# 3) Modify "atomdict.db" into the directory "~/dowser/DATA" to allow Dowser to recognize the RET or any other chromophore
# 
# 4) Update sample-ARMconfig file (See details in that file) and then run install.sh 
#
#
#
# Running APEC protocol
#
# 1) Create the xyz file of the cromophore containing the coordinates, atom types, conectivities and QM/MM model in the following way:
#    - Extract the chromophore from the pdb file and create the file chromophore.pdb (it can be any name)
#    - Add the hydrogens using babel code (install babel from here:https://openbabel.org/wiki/Category:Macintosh):
#      babel -ipdb -h 'chromophore.pdb' -opdb 'chromophoreH.pdb'
#    - chromophoreH.pdb contains the hydrogen atoms and also the conectivities
#    - from chromophoreH.pdb create a XYZ file (chromophore.xyz) like this one:
#
#    41
#  PDB_labels       X       Y       Z     AMBER_Atom_type  QM/MM model
#    C1          -0.573  -0.262   0.118        CT              QM
#    C2          -1.449   0.737  -0.336        CA              MM
#    H3          -2.829   0.561  -0.349        H1              LQ
#    ...                                         
#    C5           5.007  -1.386  -0.211        CB              LM
#    C5           5.067  -3.376  -0.513        CB              XX
#    C1  C2
#    C1  H3
#    ...
#    End
#
#
# 2) Prepare the pdb file of the protein (without the chromophore) with the correct protonation states (Using PropKa: https://github.com/jensengroup/propka-3.1) 
#
# 3) Copy New_ASEC_99sb.sh file to the same directory with the pdb file of the protein and chromophore.xyz
#
# 4) Run New_ASEC_99sb.sh
#
#
## "seqmut file (For Mutation) 
##
## The mutation routine is activated ONLY if you place a file named "seqmut"
## in the same folder as the initial PDB file and New.sh. In that file mutations have 
## to be placed in one of the following standard format for replacements:
##     S83G
##     Tyr96Arg
## The script is case-insensitive, so also s83g, TYR78lys and so on would be accepted. 
##
## Mixed 1- and 3-letters codes will not be properly read. 
##
## If you want to perform more than 1 substitution, just list them on different lines in the same file.
